So. What is fluidizer?

Basically, I felt fixed-width layouts were really wasteful. With the advent of really large monitors, I don't consider mine large at all, but my left monitor is 1600px wide. Why is it that many if not most sites are still stuck with a 900px-wide content area? Heaven forbid layouts with even *less* than that, but I've seen it.

There probably is some typographical eye-tracking scientific super-awesome explanation-- maybe the eye just hates having to skim long lines and has an urge to jump sixteen pixels down. 

I have to admit, even I don't ever use fluidizer myself, but it was an interesting experiment.

This was developed some ancient time ago, well, fluidizer-beta was last modified 16 Feb 2010 at 06:45:59 PM EST. fluidizer-simple at 16 Feb 2010 06:44:53 PM EST. fluidizer-complex at Tue 16 Feb 2010 06:45:51 PM EST. fluidizer at Tue 16 Feb 2010 06:08:46 PM EST. fixedwidth at Mon 15 Feb 2010 07:54:53 PM EST.

I don't remember which one was the latest one and I won't bother reading the dates from the paragraph above which I just pasted in from the nautilus properties dialog. Anyway, there was one in my bookmars bar which was named "Fluid3" and there weren't any other ones so I assume that means that was the good one, but I don't know which file that corresponds to, so I just copied it over to a new bookmarklet.js

Have fun.
